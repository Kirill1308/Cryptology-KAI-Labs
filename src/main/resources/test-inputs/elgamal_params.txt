El-Gamal Parameters (Lab 2)
===========================

Test values (small for demonstration):
Large prime (p): 467
Primitive root (g): 2
Private key (x): 153

Calculated values:
Public key = g^x mod p = 2^153 mod 467 = 166

Larger prime example:
Large prime (p): 2003
Primitive root (g): 2
Private key (x): 1234

Note: For secure communication, use much larger primes (1024+ bits).
