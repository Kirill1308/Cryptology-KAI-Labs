Rabin Parameters (Lab 3/4)
==========================

Test values (small for demonstration):
Prime p (≡ 3 mod 4): 59
Prime q (≡ 3 mod 4): 103

Calculated values:
n = p * q = 6077

Larger primes example:
Prime p (≡ 3 mod 4): 1999
Prime q (≡ 3 mod 4): 2003

n = p * q = 4003997

Note: For Rabin algorithm, p and q must be ≡ 3 (mod 4).
Note: These are small primes for testing. Use larger primes in production.
